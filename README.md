### Support Contracts

#### MockPriceFeed (for testing) (0xA1CBEe55b7f8B7A161528B44b27196671a09DEe2)

A test contract that mimics Chainlink's AggregatorV3Interface for development and testing purposes.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract MockPriceFeed {
    int256 public price = 200000000000;
    uint256 public updatedAt = block.timestamp;
    uint80 public roundId = 1;
    uint256 public startedAt = block.timestamp;
    uint80 public answeredInRound = 1;

    // Returns mock price data in Chainlink format
    function latestRoundData()
        external
        view
        returns (uint80, int256, uint256, uint256, uint80)
    {
        return (roundId, price, startedAt, block.timestamp, answeredInRound);
    }

    // Updates the mock price
    function setPrice(int256 _price) external {
        price = _price;
        updatedAt = block.timestamp;
        roundId++;
        answeredInRound = roundId;
    }
}
```

#### DemoToken (for testing)(lendTokenAddress - 0xB1BF661cf9C19cb899400B0E62D8fc87AA3a22C6) (depositTokenAddress - 0x6588DC27Caa6314A8f99321b5cCB7c1977E1a8bF)

A simple ERC20 token implementation for testing the protocol.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract DemoToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol) ERC20(name, symbol) {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** 18);
    }
}
```

## üìä Contract Integration with Pharos Network

For the Pharos Network DevNet integration, we've made specific adaptations:

1. **Optimized Gas Usage**: Refactored loops and storage patterns to reduce gas costs on Pharos
2. **Created our own mock price oracle**: Modified price feed implementations to work seamlessly with Pharos Network
3. **Created two mock tokens one for lending(LEND) and one for deposit(WETH)**

The integration demonstrates our commitment to supporting emerging blockchain infrastructures while maintaining the core functionality that makes BlockCoop powerful.
